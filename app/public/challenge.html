        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office.
            <br><br>In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which attracted the attention of the academic world; the first outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, the second paper explained Brownian motion, the third paper introduced special relativity, and the fourth mass-energy equivalence. That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. </p>

            <br><br>
             “The African rhythm, even when it's not obvious, is in our music. I think our responsibility now is to make sure that it goes to the mainstage, and it's not pigeonholed to ‘world music’ or put on smaller stages as ‘world music artists.’ We can be where everyone is.” </p>
